			<p>Scene: Same as in First Act. There are neither curtains on the windows nor pictures on the walls: only a little furniture remains piled up in a corner as if for sale. There is a sense of desolation; near the outer door and in the background of the scene are packed trunks, travelling bags, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> On the left the door is open, and from here the voices of <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Varya</b> and <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Anya</b> are audibl . <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Lopahin</b> is standing waiting. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Yasha</b> is holding a tray with glasses full of champagne. In front of the stage <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Epihodov</b> is tying up a box. In the background behind the scene a hum of talk from the peasants who have come to say goodbye. The voice of <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Gaev</b>: “Thanks, brothers, thanks!”</p>
