			<p>A drawing-room divided by an arch from a larger drawing-room. A chandelier burning. The Jewish orchestra, the same that was mentioned in Act <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, is heard playing in the anteroom. It is evening. In the larger drawing-room they are dancing the grand chain. The voice of <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Seyonov-Pishtchik</b>: “<i xml:lang="fr">Promenade à une paire!</i>” Then enter the drawing-room in couples, first <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Pishtchik</b> and <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Charlotta Ivanovna</b>, then <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Trofimov</b>and <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Lyubov Andreyevna</b>, thirdly <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Anya</b> with the <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Post-Office Clerk</b>, fourthly <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Varya</b> with the <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Station Master</b>, and other guests. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Varya</b> is quietly weeping and wiping away her tears as she dances. In the last couple is <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Dunyasha</b>.
